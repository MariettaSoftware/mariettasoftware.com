Song:
30. Hear O Lord

Hear, O LORD, and answer, I am poor and needy,
Guard my life for I am devoted to You.
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and my cry for mercy,
In the day of trouble I will call to You.
Verse:
Teach me, O LORD, I will walk in Your truth,
Give me an undivided heart.
Nations You've made will worship You,
For You alone are the living God.
Verse:
I will praise You, I will praise You,
Glorify Your name, O LORD,
I will praise You, I will praise You,
Glorify Your name, O LORD.
