Song:
78. Without Him

Without Him I could do nothing
Without Him I'd surely fail
Without Him I would be drifting
Like a ship without a sail

Chorus:
Jesus, O Jesus!
Do you know him today?
Do not turn away!
Oh Jesus, O Jesus,
Without Him, how lost I would be.

Verse:
Without Him I would be dying
Without Him I'd be enslaved;
Without Him life would be hopeless
But with Jesus, thank God, I'm saved.
