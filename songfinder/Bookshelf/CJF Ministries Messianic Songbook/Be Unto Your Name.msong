Song:
81. Be Unto Your Name

Verse:
We are a moment, You are forever
Lord of the Ages, God before time
We are a vapor, You are eternal
Love everlasting, reigning on high

Chorus:
Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Highest praises, honor and glory
Be unto Your Name
Be unto Your Name

Verse:
We are the broken, You are the Healer
Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save
You are the Love Song we'll sing forever
Bowing before you, blessing Your Name
