Words and Music:  Unknown

Dm               F      G        Dm
Get you up on a high mountain, Zion,
 F                G
Herald of good tidings.
Dm                  C G    Dm
Lift your voice and fear not;
Dm           F         G
Say to the cities of Judah,
Dm          F G
Behold your God;
Dm               F  G Bb C  Dm
Lift your voice and fear  not.
