F                            
One door, and only one, 
        C   F     C7  F
and yet its sides are two.
Bb         F          
Inside and outside, 
   B°    G7       C7
on which side are you?
F                              
One door, and only one, 
        C   F     C7  F
and yet its sides are two.
Bb         F        
I'm on the inside, 
   F/C   C7       F
on which side are you?
