V:
Csus2     Dsus4          Gsus2
Be still, my soul, the Lord is on thy side
Csus2 Dsus4             Gsus2
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain
Em     Gsus2        Dsus4
Leave to thy God to order and provide
Gsus2     D             Em
In every change He faithful will remain
Csus2     Gsus2              Dsus4
Be still, my soul, thy best, thy heavenly friend
Gsus2      D           Gsus2
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end


V:
Csus2     Dsus4         Gsus2
Be still, my soul, thy God doth undertake
Csus2  Dsus4         Gsus2
To guide the future as He has the past
Em    Gsus2             Dsus4
Thy hope, thy confidence, let nothing shake
Gsus     Dsus4              Em
All now mysterious shall be bright at last
Csus2     Gsus2                 Dsus4
Be still, my soul, the waves and winds still knowing
Gsus2      Dsus4            Gsus2
His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below


Chorus:
D              Csus2    Gsus2
In you I rest, in You I found my hope
D                Csus2     Gsus2
In you I trust, You never let me go
D                Csus2  Gsus2 Dsus4
I place my life within your hands alone
Csus2     Gsus2
Be still, my soul 


V:
Csus2     Dsus4             Gsus2
Be still, my soul, the hour is hastening on 
Csus2 Dsus4         Gsus2
When we shall be forever with the Lord
Em         Gsus2               Dsus4
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone
Gsus2       D             Em
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored
Csus2      Gsus2                Dsus4
Be still, my soul, when change and tears are past
Gsus2   D                Gsus2
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last


Chorus:
D              Csus2    G2
In you I rest, in You I found my hope
D                Csus2     Gsus2
In you I trust, You never let me go
D                Csus2  Gsus2 Dsus4
I place my life within your hands alone
Csus2     Gsus2
Be still, my soul [REPEAT CHORUS]
