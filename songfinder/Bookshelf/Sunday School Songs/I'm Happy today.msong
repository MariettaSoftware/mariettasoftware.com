D                   G
I'm happy today, so happy today
   D                A
In Jesus' Name, I'm happy today.
A7   D            G
He's taken all my sins away
       D          A7    D
That's why I'm so happy today.

V:
One talent have I to take to the sky

While others are blest with ten of the best.

Why should I complain, from duty refrain?

No, never, no, never, not I.
