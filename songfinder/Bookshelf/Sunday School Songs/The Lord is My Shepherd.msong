G               
The Lord is my Shepherd,
     D7              G
I'll walk with Him alway.

He leads me by still waters
     D7              G
I'll walk with Him alway.
                   D7              G
Alway, alway, I'll walk with Him alway
                   D7              G
Alway, alway, I'll walk with Him alway.
