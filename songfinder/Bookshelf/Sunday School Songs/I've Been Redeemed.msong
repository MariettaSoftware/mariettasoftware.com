D
I've been redeemed

By the blood of the Lamb!
             A7
I've been redeemed
                    D
By the blood of the Lamb!
     D7     G
I've been redeemed

By the blood of the Lamb,
                D    F#7     Bm
Filled with the Holy Ghost I am.
       Em               A7
All my sins are washed away,
            D
I've been redeemed.
