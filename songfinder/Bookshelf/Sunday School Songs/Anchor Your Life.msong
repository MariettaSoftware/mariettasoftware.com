C           Am       
Anchor your life, my friend
C  G7    C
In Jesus Christ.
F               C     G7
He'll take your sins away
C   D            G   F G7
And give eternal L-I-F-E
C               Am 
Christ wants to guide your life,
C    G7    C
Your pilot be.
F          C        E
So let Him take the helm
Am  C             G7       C
And lead you on into eternity.
