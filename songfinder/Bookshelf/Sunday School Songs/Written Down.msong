G             D7
Written down, written down
                      G
Written down, written down.


Chorus:
                      D7
All of the things God wants me to know

Are here in the Bible, 
        G
Written down!


V:
God so loved the world

That He gave His son.

V:
For by grace we're saved,

By faith, not works.

V:
Thank You, Lord, for all things

That You've done for us!
